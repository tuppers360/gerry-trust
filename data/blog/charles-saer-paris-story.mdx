In our opinion, there are no boundaries to what we can achieve in school and having
the ability to show our children that there is a life and a world beyond the estate
that they live on is priceless. The aim every year with this visit is to raise the
aspirations of our children, to give them a goal and a view of life that many of
them sadly don't see. Many of our children have never been outside of Fleetwood,
let alone travelling by plane to another country. Finances are the only barrier for
our children and we hope by showing them some of what the world has to offer it will
give them the drive to want to work hard in education so that they can experience
such trips for themselves in the future.

Once again, we had a fantastic trip this year, the buzz of excitement always begins
at school as the children wave goodbye to their families from the coach windows.
The airport is another new experience for them, talking to check-in staff and answer
the usual travel questions is a fantastic learning experience before, what is often
the main event, the flight itself.

In Paris, we visited small village patisseries,
the Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, the River Sienne and the Arc de Triomphe as well as
spending a magical day at Disneyland Paris. It's a life and an experience so far
from their own lives in Fleetwood that each and every excursion is greeted with big
smiles and excitement. There's even the opportunity to try some local delicacies,
with snails being on the menu for the children to try at dinner!!!

Sadly, our visit next year has had to be cancelled because of the pandemic but we
hope to resume this annual visit as soon as it's safe to do so.

Thank you so much for your support, I don't think the trip would be possible without it.
